To compile and run on linux: 

%> make 
%> make run


To compile and run on windows:

%> make.bat 
%> make.bat run

Notes:

- Make sure json_simple-1.1.jar is in your classpath
- input.json is required in order for the program to run 
- For every instance that you need you need to run. So if input.json specifies 4 proccesses that means you need to have make run running for times concurrently.
